# Kupala's Night / Свято Купала
A simple 2D game centered around the Ukrainian Holiday of Свято Купала (Kupala's night). Made during the United With Ukraine GameJam held in Warsaw, July 2022.  

The game consists of several levels, where the player must traverse a forest and collect all the flowers. However, the maze is invisible - the player has to memorize it while standing near a campfire, which temporarily reveals the path. Mischievous spirits also lurk in the forest, which must be avoided. Between the levels, the player can enjoy a variety of minigames that are inspired by traditional Kupala's night celebrations, such as jumping over the campfire or releasing wreaths onto the river.
